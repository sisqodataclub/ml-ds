JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted its forecast for US economic growth after a temporary trade deal between the US and China, dropping its earlier call that the world’s largest economy would sink into a recession in 2025.

“The administration’s recent dialing down of some of the more draconian tariffs placed on China should reduce the risk that the US economy slips into recession this year,” JPMorgan Chief US Economist Michael Feroli said Tuesday in a note. “We believe recession risks are still elevated, but now below 50%.”

Feroli said the bank now sees the US economy growing 0.6% in 2025, up from 0.2% previously, and a key measure of underlying inflation — based on the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy — rising to 3.5% instead of 4%.


J.P.Morgan ratcheted up its odds for a U.S. and global recession to 60%, as brokerages scrambled to revise their forecast models with tariff distress threatening to sap business confidence and slow down global growth.

"Disruptive U.S. policies have been recognized as the biggest risk to the global outlook all year," the brokerage said in a note on Thursday, adding that the country's trade policy has turned less business friendly than anticipated.
"The effect ... is likely to be magnified through (tariff) retaliation, a slide in U.S. business sentiment and supply-chain disruptions."
S&P Global also raised its "subjective" probability of a U.S. recession to between 30% and 35%, from 25% in March.

Other research firms including Barclays, BofA Global Research, Deutsche Bank, RBC Capital Markets and UBS Global Wealth Management also warned the U.S. economy faces a higher risk of slipping into a recession this year if Trump's new levies remain in place.
Barclays and UBS warned the U.S. economy could enter into contraction territory, while other analysts forecast economic growth broadly between 0.1% and 1%.
