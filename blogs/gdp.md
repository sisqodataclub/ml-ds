### Key Points Explained  

1. **What Are Tariffs?**  
    Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They can make foreign products more expensive, encouraging consumers to buy domestic alternatives. However, they can also disrupt global trade and supply chains.  

2. **Impact on the US Economy**  
    - The US's aggressive tariff policies have led to slower economic growth, higher consumer prices, and reduced investor confidence.  
    - The IMF predicts a 40% chance of a US recession in 2025, with GDP growth dropping to 1.8%.  

3. **China's Economic Challenges**  
    - China's GDP growth is expected to decline to 3.954% in 2025 due to trade tensions and internal adjustments.  
    - A slight recovery is projected for 2026.  

4. **Global Effects**

    <p><strong>Projected GDP Growth</strong></p>
</div>
    - Other countries, like the UK, are also experiencing slower growth but show signs of recovery in 2026.  
    - The IMF forecasts global growth to slow to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3%.  

5. **Call for Collaboration**  
    Policymakers are urged to prioritize free trade and international cooperation to stabilize the global economy.  

### Why It Matters  
Understanding these trends helps everyone grasp how interconnected the global economy is. Tariffs may seem like a local policy, but their effects ripple across borders, influencing prices, jobs, and economic stability worldwide.
