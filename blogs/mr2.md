# How to Grow Your Business  

In Part 1 of this series, we explored two common traps business owners fall into: skipping market research and ignoring the numbers. But knowing the problem is only half the battleâ€”the real value lies in using market research and business intelligence (BI) to build a smarter, more resilient business.  

In this post, weâ€™ll dive into actionable steps to implement these two pillars effectively, starting with your own business.  

## ðŸ§­ Step 1: Research Your Own Company First  

Before researching your competitors or chasing customers, start by analyzing your own business. Many companies make decisions without clearly understanding what they sell, who they serve best, or how their internal processes work.  

### ðŸ§¾ Know Your Company  

Before you can understand the market, you must understand your own company. This is the foundational step in both market research and business intelligence. It means profiling your own business with the same objectivity and detail you would apply to a competitor or potential partner.  

#### 1. Basic Information  
Start by documenting the essentials:  

- **Business Name**: The legal and trading names used publicly.  
- **Type of Business**: Sole trader, partnership, limited company, etc.  
- **Registration Number**: Often required for official or financial reporting.  
- **Industry Sector**: Define your sector clearly (e.g., residential cleaning, commercial janitorial, niche services like medical or industrial cleaning).  
- **Location**: Your base of operations and the geographic area you serve.  
- **Founding Date**: Offers context on your maturity and growth potential.  
- **Ownership Structure**: Is it founder-owned? Family-run? VC-backed? Each has implications for operations and decision-making.  

#### 2. Products and Services  
Be crystal clear on what you actually offer:  

- **Core Services**: These are your bread and butterâ€”e.g., daily office cleaning or end-of-tenancy cleans.  
- **Peripheral Services**: Add-ons like window washing, carpet cleaning, or deep sanitisation.  
- **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: What makes you stand out? It could be eco-friendly products, flexible scheduling, 24-hour service, or highly trained staff.  

Understanding your own business in these terms gives you a solid internal framework to compare against external realities. It also helps in positioning, pricing, and aligning your resources with your market strategy.
